# Andrew Markel's Web-Based Code Portfolio

Hi! I'm Andrew Markel, and this repository contains some of my web-based projects hosted on GitHub Pages, ranging from advanced medical research visualization to video game prototypes.

At https://markelpolo.github.io/model-viewer/, you will find a site that I created to view and present some 3D models that I generated in my PhD research. My research focuses on studying female reproductive diseases using ultrasound imaging and an experimental imaging technique called photoacoustic imaging, which uses lasers to generate ultrasound waves that provide information on the molecular composition of the subject. Pre-loaded in the experience are coregistered 3D models of the reproductive tract of a female mouse reconstructed from ultrasound images (grey, anatomical data) and photoacoustic images (red, collagen molecular data). This app is best experienced on a touch screen device. Rotate the model using 1 or 2 fingers and scale the model using 2 fingers. 

Coming soon: option to load other models into viewer, toggle for different data types (ultrasound vs. photoacoustic view), and extended reality viewing options (VR/AR).

At https://markelpolo.github.io/friday-route/, you will find a prototype of an endless runner style minigame designed to accompany an animated series that I am producing. In the pilot episode of the series, a mailman gets caught stealing packages by one of the customers along his route and proceeds to barrage the customer with mail. In the accompanying video game, you play as the customer dodging various packages being thrown your way. This game can be played using either a touch screen or a keyboard. Swipe/key down to crouch and swipe/key up to stand from crouching or jump from standing. 

Coming soon: viewport fit to different orientations, character animations over primitives, collision detection, point system, and bonus scene unlocked after finishing the game.
