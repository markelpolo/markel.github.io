Hi! I'm Andrew Markel, and this repository contains some of my web-based projects hosted on GitHub Pages, ranging from advanced medical research visualization to video game prototypes.

At https://markelpolo.github.io/model-viewer/, you will find a site that I created to view and present some 3D models that I generated in my PhD research. Pre-loaded in the experience is a 3D model of the reproductive tract of a mouse reconstructed from ultrasound (grey) and photoacoustic (red) image data. My research focuses on using ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging to develop new techniques to better study the female reproductive system, so in some of my presentations I provide a QR code link to this app so that my audience can better visualize my research. Rotate the model using 1 or 2 fingers and scale the model using 2 fingers. 

Coming soon: improve model loading time, add option to load other models into viewer, and toggle for different data types (ultrasound vs. photoacoustic view).

At https://markelpolo.github.io/friday-route/, you will find a prototype of an endless runner style minigame designed to accompany an animated series that I am producing. In the pilot episode of the series, a mailman gets caught stealing packages by one of the customers along his route and proceeds to barrage the customer with mail. In the accompanying video game, you play as the customer dodging various packages being thrown your way. Swipe/key down to crouch and swipe/key up to stand from crouching or jump from standing. 

Coming soon: character animations over primitives, collision detection with packages, point system, and bonus scene unlocked after finishing the game.
