Hi! I'm Andrew Markel, and this repository contains some of my web-based projects hosted on GitHub Pages.

At https://markelpolo.github.io/model-viewer/, you will find a site that I created to view and present some 3D models that I generated in my PhD research. Pre-loaded in the experience is a 3D model of the reproductive tract of a mouse reconstructed from ultrasound (grey) and photoacoustic (red) image data. My research focuses on using ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging to develop new techniques to better study the female reproductive system, so in some of my presentations I provide a QR code link to this app so that my audience can better visualize my research.
