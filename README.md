# Andrew Markel's Web-Based Code Portfolio

Hi! I'm Andrew Markel, and this repository contains some of my web-based projects hosted on GitHub Pages, ranging from advanced medical research visualization to video game prototypes.

At https://markelpolo.github.io/model-viewer/, you will find an interactive experience for viewing 3D models. The current 3D model is the spine of a scoliosis patient, data that I collected as a part of my biomedical research. This app is best experienced on a touch screen device. Rotate the model using 1 or 2 fingers and scale the model using 2 fingers. 

In progress: option to load other models into viewer, support for non-touch interfaces, and extended reality viewing options (VR/AR/XR).

At https://markelpolo.github.io/friday-route/, you will find a prototype of an endless runner style minigame designed to accompany an animated series that I am producing. This game can be played using either a touch screen or a keyboard. To avoid the oncoming projectiles, swipe/key down to crouch and swipe/key up to stand from crouching or jump from standing.

In progress: viewport fit to different orientations, collision detection, and character animations.
